This API allows financial organisations to report Lifetime ISA (LISA) information to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and get information about payments made by HMRC.

This version of the API is in development and is very likely to change.

The current API allows the financial organisation to:

  * report a new investor to HMRC    
  * create, transfer or close a LISA account    
  * report an investor life event    
  * request a bonus payment
