This REST API allows Lifetime ISA (LISA) managers to:

* report investor information to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)
* get information about payments made by HMRC

The code in this repository is a work in progress.
 
A version of this API currently runs on the HMRC API platform and is limited to private beta testers only.
  
If you are one of our private beta testers, you should refer to the [API Developer Hub](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation) for the latest API specification. You will have to log in.
