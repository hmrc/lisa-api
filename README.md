# lisa-api

## Requirements

This service is written in [Scala 2.13](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and [Play](http://playframework.com/), needs at least a Java 11 to run.

## Description

Access this REST API on the [HMRC Developer Hub](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation).

The API allows Lifetime ISA (LISA) managers to:

* report a new investor to HMRC
* create, transfer or make changes to a LISA account
* get details of a LISA account
* report or get details of an investor life event
* request or get details of bonus payments and withdrawal charges
* get payment and debt information

## Testing Approach

You can use the sandbox environment to [test this API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/testing).

It does not currently support [stateful behaviour](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/testing/stateful-behaviour), but you can use the payloads described in Resources to test specific scenarios.

You must set up a test user which is an organisation for this API using the [Create Test User API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/api-platform-test-user/1.0#_create-a-test-user-which-is-an-organisation_post_accordion).

## Requirements

All end points are User Restricted (see [authorisation](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/authorisation)). Versioning, data formats etc follow the API Platform standards (see [the reference guide](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/reference-guide)).

You can dive deeper into the documentation in the [API Developer Hub](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/lisa-api/2.0).

## Test data

Test data for each LISA API is available on the [HMRC Developer Hub](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/lisa-api/2.0).

## Running locally

This service is written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and [Play](http://playframework.com/), so needs a [JRE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html) to run.

Install [Service Manager](https://github.com/hmrc/sm2), then start dependencies:

    sm2 --start GG_AUTH_SERVICES LISA_STUB

Start the app:

    sbt run

## Testing the Service

This service uses [sbt-scoverage](https://github.com/scoverage/sbt-scoverage) to provide test coverage reports.

Run this script before raising a PR to ensure your code changes pass the Jenkins pipeline. This runs all the unit tests with scalastyle and checks for dependency updates:

```
./run_all_tests.sh
```
