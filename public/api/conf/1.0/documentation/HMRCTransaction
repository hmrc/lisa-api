This resource is created by HMRC at the end of an accounting period.
It represents a portion of a bulk payment of money (modelled as HMRCPayment)
and how it related to a LISAAccount and LISATransaction. HMRCTransaction
resources for an HMRCPayment can be accessed by a LISAManager to determine
what the allocation of funds from the payment should be (by inspecting the
associated HMRCTransaction resources. This resource is expected to be created
before any funds are transferred using BACS or Direct Debit.
The HMRCTransaction resources will inform a LISAManager to which accounts the
charges or bonuses are allocated.
