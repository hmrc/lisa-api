This document is an HMRC Digital specification of a RESTful Application Program Interface.
The API is being produced to support the introduction of the Lifetime Independent Savings Account
or LISA.  It is intended that the API must be used by financial organisations who will offer
Lifetime ISA products to UK citizens.  It has been a decision of HM Treasury that the LISA product
will be supported by HMRC as a Digital only offering.  Hence this API specification defines the
only method offered by HMRC to prospective LISA providers.
HMRC digital intends to engage in API user research with a group of interested financial organisations
to discover their user needs.  

HMRC digital intends to refine the API to meet;
* the user needs,
* any emerging HMRC technical constraints and
* any change in policy or legislation regarding the LISA concept.

This release of the document is marked "Alpha" as it has been produced early in the delivery cycle
with the express intent to support the API user research.  It is very likely to change.  Therefore
development against an Alpha API specification is best thought of as a learning exercise.   Any
effort estimation or costing against the content of this specification must be considered as a
rough guide only.

This is a technical specification document.  Therefore, the target audience is technical staff
operating on behalf of a financial organisation who is considering offering a LISA product.  The
reader is assumed to have familiarity with RESTful API concepts and JSON and JSON Schema.
