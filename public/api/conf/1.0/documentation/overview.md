This API allows financial organisations to report Lifetime ISA (LISA) information to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and get information about payments made by HMRC.

This version of the API is in development and is very likely to change.

The current API allows the financial organisation to:

    report a new investor to HMRC
    create, transfer or close a LISA account
    report an investor life event
    request a bonus payment
    get information about HMRC payments
