This resource represents a bulk payment of money from HMRC to a single
LISAManager or vice-versa.  It is created by HMRC at the end of an accounting
period.  It can be accessed by a LISAManager to determine what the allocation
of funds from the payment should be (by inspecting the associated HMRCTransaction
resources.  This resource is expected to be created before any funds are
transferred using BACS or Direct Debit.  If the LISAManager has chosen to use
BACS to make payments to HMRC then this resource can be used to determine the
need for the payment and the amount of payment required.  The associated
HMRCTransaction resources will inform a LISAManager to which accounts the
charges or bonuses are allocated.
