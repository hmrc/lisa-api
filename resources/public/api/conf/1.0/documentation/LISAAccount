Resource represents the existence of a LISA account at a Lisa Manager.
It must be created before a LISATransaction can be created for the account.
AccountID must be generated and supplied by the LISA provider and so is only
unique when combined with LISAManagerReferenceNumber.  The associated
LISAInvestor resource must exist before a LISAAccount is created.
