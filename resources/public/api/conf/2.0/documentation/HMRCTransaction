This resource is created by HMRC at the end of an accounting period.
It represents a portion of a bulk payment of money (modelled as HMRC Payment)
and how it related to a LISA Account and LISA Transaction. HMRC Transaction
resources for an HMRC Payment can be accessed by a LISA Manager to determine
what the allocation of funds from the payment should be (by inspecting the
associated HMRC Transaction resources. This resource is expected to be created
before any funds are transferred using BACS or Direct Debit.
The HMRC Transaction resources will inform a LISA Manager to which accounts the
charges or bonuses are allocated.
